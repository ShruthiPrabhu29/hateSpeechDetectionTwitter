# hateSpeechDetectionTwitter
Authors: Shruthi P

Summary: This is a project on automated detection of hate speech on Twitter using data collected by Zeerak Waseem. We have reproduced the baseline (Pinkesh Badjatiya) results.
We have also inlcuded the other deep learning models like BiLSTM and hybrid models for deep learning feature extarction and applied the logistic regression for classification.
We have extended the experiments by combining the deep learning features with other semantic feature like TF-IDF to form hybrid features.
